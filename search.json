We could, but they tend to not be as important for growth in real GDP as we think. For the time being we’ll leave them out, and later on can incorporate information about them into the production function.\n\nKrugman quote Krugman, The New York Times, 2014:\n\nAnd you sometimes see hard scientists making arguments along the same lines, largely (I think) because they don’t understand what economic growth means. They think of it as a crude, physical thing, a matter simply of producing more stuff, and don’t take into account the many choices — about what to consume, about which technologies to use — that go into producing a dollar’s worth of G.D.P.\n\nGood comment:\n\nI beg to differ. I have a dual degree in engineering and economics. I used to believe the free-market dogma. I did very well in my economics classes. However, it was studying real science that opened my eyes. This has nothing to do with ideology and everything to do with science. You can’t decouple economic growth from growth in the consumption of natural resources and not a single economist has been able to prove that you can. It defies common sense (not to mention the basic laws of physics) to expect that something can grow infinitely within finite, constrained system. Many of our key resources, like metals, exist in fixed supply. How in the world do you reconcile that with a system that requires endless growth?\n\nGrantham Grantham, n.d.\n\nI say 90 years to allow economics 20 more years to get the point that to make bread you need wheat and heat, in addition to labor and capital. Mainstream economics decided back in the 1950s to basically ignore the limits imposed by natural resources and environmental services, including the downsides of waste products. In their methodology, capital, labor (and innovation, if you insist) were always going to be enough. Externalities were ignored and considered outside their equilibriums. ‘It’s only a question of price,’ although quite soon, that may mean that only the very rich can pay the necessary price while the rest starve. Steady productivity gains do not buy you much time mathematically either, and are in any case mostly offset quickly by the Jevons effect: the cheaper the product, the more you use.\n\nComment on Krugman’s growthism by Herman Daly:\nhttps://steadystate.org/krugmans-growthism/"

In both panels, the blue line is the scale of physical activities, which reaches a saturation point due to physical constraints. The red curves represent the total economy. If demanding continued economic growth, as in panel a, a growing gap must open so that the fraction of economic activity in the non-physical sector (purple line; right-hand axis) approaches 100%. Panel b depicts a more realistic trajectory. In this case, the non-physical elements of the economy are constrained (arbitrarily) to grow no higher than 75% of the total, resulting in only a modest amount of decoupled economic growth before flattening."

Congress.

At the dawn of the industrial revolution, Point B, humanity added the condensed stocks of hydrocarbons to previously flow-based human economies. A valid description of the Solow residual (i.e. the economic growth not explained by labor or capital) was absent during this time because the black line and red line were tracking together.\nBetween B and C we hit an energy crisis in the 1970s, which we ‘solved’ by both 1) using debt to pull consumption forward in time and 2) globalization and outsourcing to the cheapest areas of production. These changes allowed economic growth to continue until it hit a wall with conventional finance in 2008 (Point C)– at which point central banks and global governments were forced to essentially redesign the entire financial system. This new (ongoing) paradigm involved measures such as too-big-to-fail guarantees, artificially low interest rates (even negative!) (Salmon, 2019), quantitative easing, central bank balance sheet expansion and various GDP-friendly rule changes (Alderman, 2014). The continued increase in global credit allowed: access to costlier tranches of resources, more social programs, cheap financing for renewable energy, and a sustained – if tepid – return to economic growth since 2009. We are now heading towards Point D, where our global monetary representations of reality continue to decouple from the underlying biophysical reality (red curve).\nSince 2007 we have grown our global debt 3.5x faster than we’ve grown our economies bringing global debt/GDP ratio to over 300% (Tiftik et al., 2019). Most institutional experts and pundits are aware of Point D, but because of cultural energy blindness, are generally not aware of this point in relation to the red line, or even that there is a red line. Eventually we will discover that the black line (money and credit) also has limits, which ultimately are tethered to the growth enabled by energy and resource availability and cost."

The changes may in fact be so rapid that there is not enough time for natural populations to adapt.\nQuote from Cui et al, conclusions:\n\nBased on simulations using cGENIE, our estimate of the peak rate of carbon release during the end-Permian event ranges from 0.42 to 1.52 Gt C yr− 1, which is comparable to that estimated during the PETM, but significantly smaller than the fossil fuel burning rate today (9 Gt C yr− 1)."
