## About the questions

At times the questions are deliberately vague and background
information has been left out. You have to make your own assumptions
about what things are relevant to the question at hand.

Goal of menti: show

- no transition has taken place
- the size of our energy use
- how quick the growth is
- point out that it takes energy to get energy

Discussion slides

- Human labor contained in one barrel of oil:
  - Human work: 0.6 kWh/dayOne barrel of oil: 1700 kWh
  - 1700/0.6 ~ 2800 days ~ 11 years (working ~260 days per year)
- Shovel vs machine comparison
  - Assuming a human uses 300 kcal/hour and moves 0.34 m3
  - A John Deere uses 273,312 kcal/hour and moves 101.93 m3
  - Bagger 293 uses 16.5 MW/hour and moves 14,158 m3
  - The human wins at 0.271 m3 / MJ, Bagger 293 is second with 0.238
    m3 / MJ and John Deere last at 0.089 m3 / MJ
- stacked graph of historical energy use by type (oil/coal/...)
- point out that the peak question has two answers, one for relative
  use, one for absolute. The point is to highlight that we keep
  *adding* energy to the mix, we're not replacing; there is no energy
  transition
- on the future of increased use:
  - graph of global total energy use, point out that we're at 19TW
    now, and extend it 2-300 years into the future - this could be a
    good point to introduce the rule of 70; first the graph is until
    today, ask what they think it will be in year 2100, introduce rule
    of 70, extend the x axis
    - this s Tom Murphy's planetary energy plot
  - non-renewables: point out the maybe not so obvious fact that they
    generate heat => 19TW negligible, 500TW => 1W/m2, equivalent to
    today's radiative forcing (at XXXW we would - literally - boil the
    water of the planet). Asimov makes this point in some book, find ref.
  - yes, the energy flow from the sun is 10000 times higher than our
    current use => energy is abundant?
    - show Smil's graph of energy flows (sankey diagram of sun ->
      earth) -> much of the primary energy is lost, only 87000 TW
      reaches Earth'ssurface
    - however, biosphere energy use is 100 TW - why not higher?
    - much of the energy is used by Earth to do stuff; make winds,
      currents, (see Antonio Turiel): if we tamper with this will have
      unintended downstream consequences (find article on solar panels
      on Arabic peninsula that have affeceted precipitation)
    - renewables require much space
- Marion King Hubbert's figure 30? utopian future vision of energy -
  also hints at the carbon pulse
- on EROI - it takes energy to get energy? Drake well vs Deep water
  horizon? Could fit better under economy and efficiency and the segue
  to technological advances

See
<https://ourworldindata.org/energy-mix#it-s-the-total-amount-of-fossil-fuels-we-burn-that-matters-and-we-continue-to-burn-more-each-year>

They claim that "we need to displace existing fossil fuels in the
energy mix much faster", despite the evidence that this is not
happening *at all*.

Quote Fressot: that all energy types are increasing is a trivial
observation; the question is *why* they are increasing. His thesis is
that there is a symbiosis between energy types (steel is required to
transport oil, for steel more coal is needed etc)

Quote on the unimportance of energy, materials:
<https://growthecon.com/StudyGuide/solow/production.html>

> Notice that I didn’t include anything explicit about natural
> resources or raw materials here. We could, but they tend to not be
> as important for growth in real GDP as we think. For the time being
> we’ll leave them out, and later on can incorporate information about
> them into the production function.

Krugman quote [@krugman_OpinionErrorsEmissions_2014]:

> And you sometimes see hard scientists making arguments along the
> same lines, largely (I think) because they don’t understand what
> economic growth means. They think of it as a crude, physical thing,

Good comment:

> I beg to differ. I have a dual degree in engineering and economics.
> I used to believe the free-market dogma. I did very well in my
> economics classes. However, it was studying real science that opened
> my eyes. This has nothing to do with ideology and everything to do
> with science. You can't decouple economic growth from growth in the
> consumption of natural resources and not a single economist has been
> able to prove that you can. It defies common sense (not to mention
> the basic laws of physics) to expect that something can grow
> infinitely within finite, constrained system. Many of our key
> resources, like metals, exist in fixed supply. How in the world do
> you reconcile that with a system that requires endless growth?

Grantham [@grantham_SustainabilityBustSheer_]

> I say 90 years to allow economics 20 more years to get the point
> that to make bread you need wheat and heat, in addition to labor
> and capital. Mainstream economics decided back in the 1950s to
> basically ignore the limits imposed by natural resources and
> environmental services, including the downsides of waste products.
> In their methodology, capital, labor (and innovation, if you
> insist) were always going to be enough. Externalities were ignored
> and considered outside their equilibriums. ‘It’s only a question of
> price,’ although quite soon, that may mean that only the very rich
> can pay the necessary price while the rest starve. Steady
> productivity gains do not buy you much time mathematically either,

a,b, Model scenarios for economic growth in the face of stalled or
steady physical resources. In both panels, the blue line is the scale
of physical activities, which reaches a saturation point due to
physical constraints. The red curves represent the total economy. If
demanding continued economic growth, as in panel a, a growing gap must
open so that the fraction of economic activity in the non-physical
sector (purple line; right-hand axis) approaches 100%. Panel b depicts
a more realistic trajectory. In this case, the non-physical elements
of the economy are constrained (arbitrarily) to grow no higher than
75% of the total, resulting in only a modest amount of decoupled
economic growth before flattening.

- are there limits to technological progress?
- is technological progress rate increasing or declining?
- Tom Murphy's example of time travel 1870->1950 vs 1950-> today, who
  sees most transformative progress

Segue:

so if getting more energy is difficult and we are so coupled to
energy/materia is a potential route efficiency?

Goal:

- discuss limits of technology (often from a thermodynamic lens)
- objection: what if you limit

Resources:

- DN ledare about using AI to improve material use 1% per year

Graphs:

- from Marc Andreesen tech-optimism to more gloomy prediction; fill in
  betweens
- our world in data graph on tech dev
- Tom Murphy's graph of light and S-curve of tech development
- S-curve of the ensembl of technologies; we have in fact picked the
  low hanging fruit; could it be the slowdown in progress is because
  of this (here, point to articles in Nature, Ulf Danielsson, hell
  even Peter Thiel, on the slowdown of discoveries); also point out
  that the rate must be normalized by population size and GDP spent on
  research

For more negative review of McAfee I may be thinking of Carey King's
treatment in the economic superorganism

Fail to point out two things:

1. efficiency limits -> S-curves
2. aggregate that counts -> rebound effect (halved fuel consumtion
   does not lead to halved emissions) -> the *intent* is crucial to
   understanding efficiency, often implicit assumption is growth

Every doubling consumes as much resources as the **entire** previous history!

::: {.fragment}

<h4>Rule of 70</h4>

Given a growth rate $r$ (annual, generational, ...) in percent, the
doubling time is roughly equivalent to $70 / r$.

:::

::: {.fragment}

So an annual growth rate of 1% means 70 doubling time, 2% 35 years, etc.

A 2.1% growth rate has a doubling time of 30 years, or 3.3 per century
-> a factor 10!
