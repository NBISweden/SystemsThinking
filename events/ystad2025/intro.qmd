## Session format

Friendly discussions of a topic of interest.

- What’s the scope of the problem?
- What do we know from the current science, and what do we see in our
  support projects that are relevant to the problem?
- What would it take to alleviate the impacts/come to terms with the
  issue?

#### Code of conduct

These are *very* complex wide-boundary problems and topics.

- no one has all the answers
- we can learn from each other
- agree to disagree and be kind to those who hold different opinions

#### Layout

- Mentimeter questions on some topic to gauge what people think
- A couple of slides with facts that aim to further the discussion

::: {.notes}

Wide-boundary problem: implies a problem where reductionist thinking
falls short and instead a systems approach is needed for understanding

For future session: as we may come across as pessimistic, could be an
opportunity for someone with a more optimistic outlook to present a
different perspective

FIXME: should this come later? what is the transition from the great
acceleration? Maybe that this is a good model for understanding the
ideological conflicts and background to why planetary boundaries has
become a problem

[king_EconomicSuperorganismCompeting_2021]

Energy narratives: fossil fuels are the future vs renewable energy is
the future. Both of these narratives make use of economy narratives to
justify their arguments:

techno-optimism uses technological innovation and infinite
substitutability, and price signals will automagically usher out the
use of detrimental products in exchange for better ones. This
narrative does not deny that Earth is finite, just that this fact will
not affect social outcomes

techno-realism says that Earth imposes biophysical limits on growth
that in the long run will affect social outcomes.

Example of the technorealist narrative.

Comments Dennis Meadows has made about the graph:

- the graph is **not** a prediction; it's a systems framework for
  thinking about growth and the interconnectedness of variables
- don't pay too much attention to the downward trajectories - this is
  a different regime and likely impossible to model; the authors even
  considered leaving these parts out
- years don't matter; however, the "You are here" was added by Dennis
  Meadows after the 30-year update as data indicate we are following
  the trajectories in the plot
- recent research (Herrington, Turner) also indicate we are following
  trajectories

Fun (?) fact: we are currently emitting CO2 at a rate that is
estimated to be 10-50 times higher than that which caused the mother
of all extinctions, the Permian mass extinction 252 MYA

@wu_SixfoldIncreaseAtmospheric_2021, @cui_InitialAssessmentCarbon_2013

:::

:::

::: {.notes}

Keeling curve: point out before 800k time series that CO2 levels have
been **remarkably** stable during the Anthropocene, since the
beginning of civilization, to the point that it is believed (whom?)
this was a necessary condition for civilization to flourish in the
first place

On the rate of CO2 emission: an issue seldom discussed in media is
that although the assumption is humans will adapt to new climates due
to technology and inherent adaptability, very little is said about
wildlife. The changes may in fact be so rapid that there is not enough
time for natural populations to adapt.

Quote from Cui et al, conclusions:

> Based on simulations using cGENIE, our estimate of the peak rate of
> carbon release during the end-Permian event ranges from 0.42 to 1.52
> Gt C yr− 1, which is comparable to that estimated during the PETM,
> but significantly smaller than the fossil fuel burning rate today (9
> Gt C yr− 1).

Doughnut Economics: just **one** way of thinking; the goals are
probably not controversial; however, the means (column 2) are (e.g.,
dropping focus on GDP). The systems dynamic approach (4) is gaining
some traction among economists, although still being ignored by most
(ref?)
